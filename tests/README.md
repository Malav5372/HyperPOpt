# Tests

## Supporting Files
- "file_resources" is a directory containing sample files used by unittests. It does not contain any tests itself
    - Also, note that this is completely separate from any temporary file fixtures used by any unittests
    - "file_resources" is expected to exist before testing starts, and it is expected to remain unchanged after testing
